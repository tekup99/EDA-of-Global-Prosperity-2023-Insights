The Legatum Prosperity Index is a comprehensive ranking of countries based on various dimensions of prosperity and development. It encompasses indicators such as safety and security, personal freedom, governance, social capital, investment environment, enterprise conditions, market access and infrastructure, economic quality, living conditions, health, education, and natural environment. By examining these indicators, insights into the factors that contribute to the overall prosperity of nations are gained.\n\nThe analysis includes:\n\n- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** The dataset is tidied and prepared for analysis by addressing any inconsistencies or missing values.\n- **Descriptive Statistics:** The central tendencies, dispersions, and distributions of the indicators are summarized.\n- **Visualizations:** Various plots are created to illustrate the relationships and distributions of the indicators, including a world map to visualize the geographical distribution of the average scores.\n- **Correlation Analysis:** The correlations between different indicators are investigated to understand how they interact with each other.\n\nIn subsequent stages, separate notebooks will be used for:\n\n- **[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tarktunataalt/global-prosperity-pca-distance-insights):** To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the most significant indicators.\n- **[K-Means Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tarktunataalt/k-means-clustering-global-prosperity-2023):** To group countries into clusters based on their prosperity indicators.\n- **[K-Medoids Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tarktunataalt/k-medoids-clustering-global-prosperity-2023):** To provide an alternative clustering method that is less sensitive to outliers.\n\nThrough this EDA, patterns and relationships within the data that can provide valuable insights into the factors driving prosperity across different countries are uncovered. This analysis also serves as a foundation for more advanced modeling and hypothesis testing in future studies.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(corrplot)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(rnaturalearthdata)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\ndata=read.csv(\"/kaggle/input/2023-global-country-development-and-prosperity-index/data.csv\")\nhead(data)","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-30T11:11:26.515973Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-30T11:11:26.518231Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-30T11:11:26.614402Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# BOXPLOT VISUALIZATIONS","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n\ndata_long <- data %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Country, names_to = \"Indicator\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nggplot(data_long, aes(x = Indicator, y = Value, fill = Indicator)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(title = \"Boxplots of Prosperity Indicators\",\n       x = \"Indicator\",\n       y = \"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-30T11:11:26.617875Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-30T11:11:26.619780Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-30T11:11:27.218595Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The average score (AveragScore) ranges from 25 to 75, with a median around 50. This indicates that the overall development levels of countries are widely distributed, with many countries falling around the average. The Safety and Security (SafetySecurity) indicator generally shows high values, although there are outliers where some countries have lower security levels. Personal Freedom (PersonelFreedom) and Governance (Governance) indicators similarly span a wide range, with median values around 70 and 60, respectively. This highlights significant differences in personal freedom and governance quality among countries.\n\nSocial Capital (SocialCapital), Investment Environment (InvestmentEnvironment), and Enterprise Conditions (EnterpriseConditions) indicators also vary among countries. Social capital, in particular, ranges from 30 to 80, while investment environment and enterprise conditions range from 40 to 80. These indicators reflect the diversity in social and economic structures across countries.\n\nMarket Access and Infrastructure (MarketAccessInfrastructure) and Economic Quality (EconomicQuality) indicators have a distribution between 50 and 80. This shows variability in infrastructure and market access as well as economic quality across different nations. Living Conditions (LivingConditions) indicator ranges from 40 to 90, with a median around 70, indicating substantial differences in living standards among countries.\n\nHealth (Health) and Education (Education) indicators cover a broad range (40 to 90), with median values around 60 and 70. This illustrates significant variations in healthcare services and education quality among countries. The Natural Environment (NaturalEnvironment) indicator ranges from 30 to 80, with a median around 60.

However, in this dataset, all parameters already range from 0 to 100, making it sensible to work with the data without scaling. In the unscaled graph, each indicator is presented with its own unit and scale, making it easier to understand the indicators in their original context. For example, indicators like SafetySecurity and Health have a wide distribution with several outliers. The LivingConditions indicator is spread across a wider range compared to others. Differences between indicators are evident due to each having its own scale.\n\nIn the scaled graph, all indicators are normalized to the same scale, making it easier to see differences in distributions. While the original graph shows each indicator in its own unit and scale, the normalized graph presents all indicators on the same scale, highlighting similarities and differences more clearly. Outliers are present in both graphs, but in the normalized values, they appear more centrally distributed. This comparison allows us to evaluate the distributions and performances of indicators more objectively. However, since all indicators range from 0 to 100, performing clustering analysis without scaling is also logical. This simplifies the analysis process and retains the original context of the indicators.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# CORRELATION VISUALIZATIONS","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"corr <- cor(data[,2:14], method = c(\"pearson\",\"kendall\",\"spearman\"))\ncorr","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-30T11:11:27.819091Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-30T11:11:27.820830Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-30T11:11:27.861297Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"corrplot.mixed(corr, \n               tl.cex = 0.4, \n               number.cex = 0.8, \n               upper = \"pie\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-30T11:11:27.864570Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-30T11:11:27.866327Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-30T11:11:28.092957Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The correlation matrix visually presents the relationships between various indicators in the 2023 Legatum Prosperity Index data.
